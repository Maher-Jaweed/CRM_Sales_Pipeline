# CRM Sales Pipeline Project:

The following data is from a B2B sales pipeline data from a ficticious company that sells computer hardware, including information on accounts, products, sales teams, and sales opportunities. 

## Question 1: How is each sales team performing compared to the rest?

- Cara Losch's team seems to be underperforming at first glance, but the east region she works in makes about 28% of the companies revenue which is shared by other teams. Cara's Team must diversify their region outreach if possible to address the below average performance. Although Dustin Brinkman's team is underperfoming in revenue generation, they are able to sell at above average rates. 

## Question 2: Are any sales agents lagging behind?

- Compared to other agents, Niesha Huffines, Wilbunr Farren, and Violet Mclelland, are underperfomring this quarter. More data is needed to understand if underperformance can be explained by a weak quarter. 

## Question 3: What products generate the most revenue and sales? 

- The highest revenue generating product is the GTXPro, while the highest sold product is the GTX Basic.
